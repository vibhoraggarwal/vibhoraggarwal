### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at [ETAS GmbH](https://www.etas.com). I graduated with a major and minor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, from [Indian Institute of Technology,Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) in 2017 and further with a master's degree in Automotive Engineering from [RWTH Aachen](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1) in 2021. Currently, I am working on productising the ETAS middleware solution. I had worked on [SET Level](https://setlevel.de/) dealing with the simulation and modelling for Level 4 and 5 automated driving system. Previously, I worked on Sensor fusion for Navigation and path planning of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with [Galileo group](http://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/IRT/Forschung/~izql/Galileo/?lidx=1) at [Institute of Automatic Control](http://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~iung/IRT/lidx/1/), [RWTH Aachen](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). I have also worked on the design and dynamics of Automotive vehicles at [IITK Motosports](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ame/sae/), Humanoid Robots at [Italian Institute of Technology, Genova](https://www.iit.it) and material handling robots for warehouse at [Grey Orange Robotics](www.greyorange.com).
